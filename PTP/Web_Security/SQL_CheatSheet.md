## SQL Testing :


- __Define__ all the user inputs and fields 

- __Confirm__ the web app backend runs SQL. One way of confi rming that the application is interacting with a backend
              database is to submit the SQL wildcard character % in a given parameter

- __Submit a single quotation__ mark as the item of data you are targeting.


- Observe whether an error occurs, or whether the result differs from the original in any other way.
  

- __submit two single quotation__ marks together for testing. Sometimes one single quote is not enough to show the error.


__Basic Payloads___


    >> ' OR 1=1 ;--
    
    >> ') OR 1=1; --
    
    
- __URL encodings__ are necessary whether you are editing the parameterâ€™s  value directly from your browser, with an intercepting 
                    proxy, or through any other means.
